Puzzle 4
Made the code return argon, struggled to make the code for this puzzle so did it this way to get the skeletonkey

Used my email but since i could run it again i had to use a number in my mail to be able to run the code from task 1 again this why the skeleton key might be different from my original christoffw@uia.no since i took it from my last code which used christoffw4@uia.no
